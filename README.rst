Scalariform Scala 2.10 Fork
===========================

This is a modified Scalariform that builds against 2.10.0 instead of 2.10-M7 like the current scalariform master. It's published into the Elogistics repository as a snapshot. 

This Github project can be removed when the real Scalariform is updated to 2.10.0.
